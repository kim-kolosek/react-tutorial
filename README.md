For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.


Under `docs/` you will be able to find explanations/reminders on how something is written (i.e. arrow functions in ES6).
Under `src/` all of the actual code will be contained.


To run the app, you need to open terminal, be in the root of the project and type `npm start`.
